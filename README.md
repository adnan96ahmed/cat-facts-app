This is a simple browser-based application that lists a random cat fact using the api provided on https://catfact.ninja/fact.
You can click the 'Get New Cat Fact' button to load another fact from the https://catfact.ninja/fact api.

The app uses:

- React, Javascript, HTML, & CSS for the front-end
- Axios for api requests
- Jest and Enzyme for unit-testing

Running the App:

1. cd into the folder containing the app
2. run 'npm install'
3. run 'npm start'

Testing the App:

1. cd into the folder containing the app
2. run 'npm test'

If I had more time, I would do the following:

- convert the files to typescript
- seperate and put the components from the Catfacts page into a seperate components folder
- add more thorough test cases for the different states on the Catfacts page (eg. loading, error, etc...)
- enhance the overall design
